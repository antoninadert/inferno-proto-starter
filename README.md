# inferno-proto-starter
An isomorphic (universal) web app starter project. This project is designed with developer productivity and happiness in mind.
This is because it uses Viewmodel for declarative components and state management. Viewmodel is easy-to-use and powerful, and fallback on Inferno (an ultra-fast, react-like library) if needed.
This starter has SSR, isomorphic routing built-in, and will render the initial component's states directly in both client and server (first server-rendering, then client rehydration).
It is also using Meteor platform for reactive data management. 
It doesn't rely on many dependancies but can already do a lot.

Technology used 
-------------
If you need to change the stack or add dependencies

1. [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for isomorphic database reactivity, isomorphic builds, SSR, exact code splitting, reactive data, user accounts, security...
2. [Viewmodel](https://viewmodel.org/) For components,internal state management, data validation(client-side), bindings between state and view... 
3. [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/) For the underlying layer of Viewmodel. It can be changed to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). See [ProtoStarter](https://github.com/antoninadert/proto-starter)
4. [Universal router](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router) and [History](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/) to provide an [easy-to-use](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router/issues/80), isomorphic router.


Installation
-------------
1. [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. In the command line, type: `git clone https://github.com/antoninadert/proto-starter.git` . Your folder must now be created
3. Go in this folder from the command line: `cd proto-starter`
4. `meteor update` (if needed)
5. `meteor npm install` (if needed)
6. `meteor npm update --save` (if needed)

`PROTIP:` If Meteor's builder gets stuck in the process, you can try to press Ctrl+C to abort some (sometime invisible) tasks and resume installation.
Pressing Ctrl+C twice will abort the run. If you do that type `meteor` again or just press up arrow.
`PROTIP2:`If you have weird behaviors, errors that reference stuff that shouldn't be there anymore, you should delete `node_modules` directory and do a `meteor npm install` again

Run
-------------
`meteor`

Then open your localhost: http://localhost:3000/


Usage
-------------
The full architecture follows [Meteor's file and folder structure](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html)

`/imports` 
This folder contains code that must be imported to be used (meteor convention). Mainly used to put your Components and Collections that will be imported later by server and client (isomorphic). 
Remember to import your components in `/both/routes.js` in order to use them. Routes are the nevralgic point of this App. 
Every component, that stores its own data, must be defined in the Routes to exist in the app.

`/both` 
This folder contains isomorphic code, used by your app and server (this is a meteor convention).
Useful for putting Routes that will themselves import components. The `_Routes.js` file must be loaded before client and server files, hence the name (first in alphabetical order) 

`/client` 
This folder contains client (browser) code, used for routing and initializing the project (browser-side).

`/server` 
This folder contains server code, used for routing and initializing the project (server-side)

Then you can start adding your ViewModel components. You don't need to import them as long as you use ViewModel's file structure to omit imports. 
You can then see the result at : http://localhost:3000/


Technology that you won't need to use
-------------
1. [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) as state management is handled by Viewmodel
2. [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as state management is handled by Viewmodel
3. [React-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) as this is easy to generate this yourself using server-render package from Meteor (See sink.appendToHead() method used in `/server/router.js` ) 
4. [React router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) as universal router is more concise and simpler


CSS
-------------
1. No CSS builder/prefixer included in the proto-starter, it should be easy to add your own.
2. Right now you can use a mix of css files and inline styles (see ViewModel styles). 
The priority order is:
`*.css files using !important` > `ViewModel Styles` > `normal *.css files` > `ViewModel styles using !important`
(due to a bug, !important don't work in inline styles) 


Caveats
-------------
1. The first time you use the project, Meteor can take a while (15 min?) to initiate. This should only happen if Meteor is changing versions (Current version: `1.5.2`), or downloading the full `npm install` from scratch with 3g connection and fucking antivirus.
2. I couldn't find a way to serve data from a MongoDB collection in the server-side, hence a special code is used to generate a fake list of items on the server-side rendering, that will be replaced by DB data when client-side rendering happens.

Useful ressources to get started
-------------
0. [Meteor with React tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) --> It should be very similar with Inferno
1. To [understand more on VM](https://forums.meteor.com/t/viewmodel-for-react-alpha/26490)
2. To [understand how async/await and promises work in Meteor](https://blog.meteor.com/using-promises-and-async-await-in-meteor-8f6f4a04f998)
3. To validate the data that goes from client to server, it could be useful to integrate [Astronomy](http://jagi.github.io/meteor-astronomy/)
4. When removing the [insecure package](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/insecure) from Meteor, it would be important to know more about [meteor publish/subscribe](https://docs.meteor.com/api/pubsub.html) and [meteor methods](https://guide.meteor.com/methods.html) (according to pub/sub mechanism)
5. It would be interesting to add [user account](https://docs.meteor.com/api/passwords.html)
6. Use [Bundle Visualizer](https://blog.meteor.com/putting-your-app-on-a-diet-with-meteor-1-5s-bundle-visualizer-6845b685a119) to check your dependencies and how they load with [exact code splitting](https://blog.meteor.com/dynamic-imports-in-meteor-1-5-c6130419c3cd)
